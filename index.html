                As an artist and graphic designer I believe that creativity is a very important quality to have. Constant learning is a way for me to think differently, in new ways; allowing me to become a strong programmer.

				During my free time outside of art, design, and coding, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, and sports. I teach tennis on weekends to kids and adults. With my art, I paint custom commissioned art pieces, with a primary focus on landscapes of the Chester County PA region. You can view my artwork here: <a class= "greenhref" href="https://www.andrewjbagwell.com">www.andrewjbagwell.com</a>, and my graphic design work here: <a class= "greenhref" href="https://www.andrewjbagwell.com/graphics">www.andrewjbagwell.com/graphics</a>.

				This portfolio goes over the projects I have created during the University of Pennsylvania LPS Coding Boot Camp as well as projects created after. Thank you for looking over my portfolio website which I created using CSS & HTML.
